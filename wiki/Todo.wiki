#summary General todo list affecting the trunk

= Introduction =

Ongoing development and fixes in the trunk should be listed here.  


= Ongoing =

*Minipackets* - Minipackets need to be fully implemented in the driver (complete), acomms_messages (rate 100), and log parsers.  

*Acomms Alog Parser* - Work in progress.

*Acomms Messages* - update string parsing methods.

= Future =

*Launch Scripting*

*Log scripting* - For fetching from vehicles, compressing, uploading to AWS.  Maybe downloading from AWS.

*auto-generated moos files* - use nsplug to generate vehicle specific mission files from meta mission and behavior files.  

*build scripting* - automatic updating, building (using distcc)

= Complete = 

*Acomms Messages* - Total number of frames and number of good frames are sometimes reported inaccurately. - Should be accurate, but careful parsing required for edge cases.

*CAIRE impulse response* - needs to be logged to MOOSDB - Full raw message now posting to ACOMMS_IMPULSE_RESPONSE

*GobyLog appending* - if driver restarted, goby log should append not overwrite. - Should now append a number to the file.

*Binary Data* - Need to test Binary data transmission through the MOOSDB and investigate how binary data is logged.  - Should now be handled by driver and posted in hex format for logging to MOOSDB.
